A couple of cheatsheets covering python, Mixed Integer Linear Programming, Probability and Statistics, adapted from "A comprehensive 10-page probability cheatsheet that covers a semester's worth of introduction to probability".

oye_cheatsheet.pdf is adapted from [Probability Cheatsheet PDF](http://www.wzchen.com/probability-cheatsheet/)

>  This cheatsheet is a 10-page reference in probability that covers a semester's worth of introductory probability.
>  The cheatsheet is based off of Harvard's introductory probability course, Stat 110. It is co-authored by former Stat 110 Teaching Fellow William Chen and Stat 110 Professor Joe Blitzstein.

The main additions are:

  - Conjugate parametric families, with applications to maximum likelihood, and bayesian inference with objective priors.
  - Summary of "Computations with one dimensional Random Variables", indicating how to compute, or approximate, probabilities and expectations for discrete, continuous random variables, and also for random variables from which we only know a sample.
  - Summary of some `python` software for statistics: scipy.stats, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels
